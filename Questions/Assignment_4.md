1. In a box of switches it is known 10% of the switches are faulty. A technicianis wiring 30 circuits, each of which needs one switch. What is theprobability that (a) all 30 work, (b) at most 2 of the circuits do not work?

2. If 10% of the Screws produced by an automatic machine are defective, find the probability that out of 20 screws selected at random, there are (i) Exactly 2 defective (ii) At least 2 defectives(iii) Between 1 and 3 defectives (inclusive)

3. Consider  a  computer  system  with  Poisson  jobaverage  of  2  per  minute. Determine  the  probability  that  in  anyone-minute  interval  there  willjob-arrival stream at an be(i) 0 jobs (ii) exactly 3jobs (iii) at most 3 jobs

4. The weekly wages of 1000 workmen are normallydistributed around amean of  Rs.  70  with  S.D  of  Rs5.Estimate  the  number  of  workers  whose  weeklywages  will  be(i)  Between  Rs  69  and  Rs  72(ii)  Less  than  Rs  69(iii)  More than Rs 72

5. In a test on 2000 Electric bulbs,it was found that the life ofparticular make, was  normally  distributed  with  an  averagelife  of  2040  hours  and  S.D  of  60 hours.  Estimate  thenumber  of  bulbs  likely  to  burn  for(i)  More  than  2150 hours(ii)  Less  than  1950  hours(iii)  More  than  1920  hours  but  less  than 2160 hours(iv) More than 2150 hours
