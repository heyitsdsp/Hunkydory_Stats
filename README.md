# Hunkydory_Stats
Contains a list of compiled questions and answers for basic statistics in the R programming language. 

## How to navigate through the repository
The [Questions](https://github.com/heyitsdsp/Hunkydory_Stats/tree/main/Questions) folder contains MD files for all the different assignments covering all the topics from basics (mean, median and mode....) to advanced (hypothesis testing, regression....). All the assignments are in order and will be updated as and when I can get my hands on more of them. Corrections are welcome as always :smile:

In the [Answers](https://github.com/heyitsdsp/Hunkydory_Stats/tree/main/Answers) folder, there are sub-folders containing the answers to each assignment in order. All the stuff is coded in R. Hope to code everything in Python soon as well! :v:
